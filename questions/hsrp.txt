Title: redundant routing with HSRP
Objective: A host can ping a remote host, but its routing isn't redundant.   The host connects to a switch, which connects into R1 int f0/0, and into R2 int f0/0.  Set up redundant routing using HSRP for these two routers, with virtual IP 192.168.0.100.  R1 should be active router (priority 105), R2 standby (priority 100), and R1 should take control again when it comes on.  The priority should decrement on R1 if its f0/1 goes down, and should decrement by 20.

Task: configure R1
R1(config)#int f0/0
R1(config-if)#standby 1 ip 192.168.0.100
R1(config-if)#standby 1 priority 105
%HSRP-6-STATECHANGE: FastEthernet0/0 Grp 1 state Speak -> Standby
%HSRP-6-STATECHANGE: FastEthernet0/0 Grp 1 state Standby -> Active
R1(config-if)#standby 1 preempt
R1(config-if)#standby 1 track f0/1 20

Note: if you could also specify the version and timers.  Do that here.

Task: use version 2, and specify the hello timer 100 ms, holdtime as 300 ms.
R1(config-if)#standby version 2
R1(config-if)#standby 1 timers msec 100 msec 300

R1(config-if)#exit
R1(config)#exit

Note: R2 is similar, with a different priority.
Note: Be sure to change the host's gateway IP!

Complete: finished R1!
